NOTES:
Thank you for installing JupyterHub!

Your release is named mdhub and installed into the namespace mdhub.

You can find if the hub and proxy is ready by doing:

 kubectl --namespace=mdhub get pod

and watching for both those pods to be in status 'Ready'.

You can find the public IP of the JupyterHub by doing:

 kubectl --namespace=mdhub get svc proxy-public

It might take a few minutes for it to appear!
